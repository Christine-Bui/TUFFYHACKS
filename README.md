## Track and Problem Statement ðŸš§

***Games using Python and pygame***

## Background ðŸ“–

Are you bored and looking for some retro nintendo like games to spice up your quarantine? We got you covered as we degisned a few pygame games which are sure to keep you hooked to your pc.

**Give life to your boredom!**

## About ðŸ”§
### What
We built a few games on the theme "arcade", "Nostalgia" and ofcourse fun in our minds! Each game has a separate challenge with interesting colours and backgrounds to keep players hooked

### Why
Often we are out of ideas when it comes to starting to code new projects or learning to create a game using pygame. Our games are aimed at newbie developers who are looking forward to learning pygame and python with some interactive and fun projects, and people stuck in quarantine, especially the elderly who would be most interested in games filled with nostalgia and a retro theme. 

### How
With a super simple **User Interface** for Boomers and Babies, in all the games and pygame along with python to bring it all to life, we created these games with a tonne of hardwork!
